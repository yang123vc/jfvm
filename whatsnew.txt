ChangeLog...

Dec 5/2015 : v0.2 released!
  - lots of bug fixes and new classes added

Nov 24/2016 : functions need to define their own local vars
  - previously the invoking function had to ensure the stack had enough room
    for the args and local vars of the called function.
    But with virtual functions this is unpredictable
    So now it's the called functions responsibility to allocate room for local vars.

Nov 22/2016 : v0.1 released!
  - first public release
